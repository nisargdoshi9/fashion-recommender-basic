## Details about the files:
*code.ipynb: A playground notebook for all the code where each code snippet can be ran individually and be understood
*main_app: Final streamlit app file with only necessary functions and codes, can be ran independently and comprises all code for the project (alongwith *filenames.pkl and features_list.pkl)
*requirements.txt: All necesasary dependencies listed

PS: Have not uploaded featue_list.pkl as it is too large and can be generated from code.ipynb extract_features function running for all filenames in "images" folder. The "images" folder should contain the dataset for images to recommend or match against (not uploaded here due to large size). The dataset used for this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small
